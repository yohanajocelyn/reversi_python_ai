Reversi AI - Setup and Installation Guide
This guide will walk you through setting up and running the Python-based Reversi (Othello) game on a new computer.

1. Install Python
First, you need to install Python from the official source.

- Go to the official Python website: python.org
- Download the latest stable version for your operating system (e.g., Python 3.12).

2. Run the Python Installer
Once the download is complete, run the installer file (e.g., python-3.12.x.exe on Windows or the .pkg file on macOS).

3. IMPORTANT: Add Python to PATH (Windows)
This is the most critical step for the installer.

On the very first screen of the Windows installer, look at the bottom.

You MUST check the box that says "Add python.exe to PATH".

If you miss this step, your computer won't know where to find Python in the terminal.

After checking the box, click "Install Now" and follow the prompts to complete the installation.

(For macOS and Linux, the installer typically handles this for you.)
